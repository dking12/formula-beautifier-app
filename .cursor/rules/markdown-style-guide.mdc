# Markdown Style Guide (Based on markdownlint)

All Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) must strictly adhere to the following style guide. These rules are based on the `markdownlint` standard to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the project.

---

## üìú General Rules

- **File Ending**: Every file must end with a single trailing newline.
- **Line Length**: Keep all lines to a maximum of **120 characters**. This rule does not apply to code blocks or tables where it would be impractical.
- **No Inline HTML**: Avoid using raw HTML for elements that can be represented with Markdown. For example, use `# Heading` instead of `<h1>Heading</h1>`.

---

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Headings

- **Single H1 Title**: Each document must start with one, and only one, H1 heading (`# Title`).
- **Incremental Levels**: Heading levels must increase by one at a time. Do not skip levels (e.g., a `##` must be followed by a `###`, not a `####`).

**Good Example**:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Section 1

### Subsection 1.1
```

**Bad Example**:

```markdown
# Document Title

### Subsection without a Section (Skipped H2)
```

---

## üìù Lists

- **Unordered Lists**: Always use a dash (`-`) for unordered list items.
- **Ordered Lists**: Always use sequential numbers followed by a period (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for ordered lists.

**Good Example**:

```markdown
- First item
- Second item

1. Step one
2. Step two
```

**Bad Example**:

```markdown
* First item (uses asterisk)
* Second item

1) Step one (uses parenthesis)
1. Step two (not sequential)
```

---

## ```` Code Blocks

- **Fenced Code Blocks**: All code blocks must be enclosed in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- **Language Specifier**: Always include a language specifier immediately after the opening backticks (e.g., \`\`\`typescript, \`\`\`json).

**Good Example**:

````markdown
```typescript
const message: string = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```
````

**Bad Example**:

````markdown
    // Indented code block is not allowed
    const message = "Hello, world!";

```
// No language specifier
const message = "Hello, world!";
```
````

---

## ‚ú® Text Formatting

- **Emphasis**: Use single asterisks for *italics* (`*italic*`) and double asterisks for **bold** (`**bold**`).
- **Links**: Brackets for link text should not have leading or trailing spaces.

**Good Example**:

```markdown
This is **important** and should be read *carefully*.

[Google](https://www.google.com)
```

**Bad Example**:

```markdown
This is __important__ and should be read _carefully_.

[ Google ](https://www.google.com)
```
